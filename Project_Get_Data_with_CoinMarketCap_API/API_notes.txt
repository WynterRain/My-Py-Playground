API = Application Programming Interface

API Example:
- You are at a restaurant
- You order your favorite dishes from the waiter who gets them from a kitchen.

Waiter = API
- Waiter takes your request and outputs the food that you ordered.
What You Order = Request
Your Food = Response
Kitchen Store Room = Database
Restaurant = Internet
You / Customer = Client
Kitchen = Server
